## üìß Gmail Integration Roadmap

### Why Gmail Integration is Critical:

**Market Size:**
- **1.8 billion Gmail users** worldwide
- **400 million Outlook users** (personal + enterprise)
- **Total addressable market: 2.2 billion users**

**User Demand:**
- Many professionals use both Outlook (work) and Gmail (personal)
- Freelancers often use Gmail
- Startups prefer Google Workspace over Microsoft 365

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Most competitors focus on ONE platform
- You'll support BOTH Outlook + Gmail
- Unified experience across email providers

---

### Gmail Integration Plan (Months 4-6):

#### Phase 1: Gmail Read Access (Month 4)
**Goal:** Read and analyze Gmail emails

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud Project
- [ ] Configure OAuth 2.0 for Gmail API
- [ ] Implement Google authentication flow
- [ ] Create Gmail service (similar to EmailService)
- [ ] Implement Gmail API integration:
  - [ ] Read messages (`gmail.users.messages.list`)
  - [ ] Get message details (`gmail.users.messages.get`)
  - [ ] Search emails (`q` parameter)
  - [ ] Get labels and categories
- [ ] Add Gmail email caching
- [ ] Implement delta sync for Gmail
- [ ] Test with personal Gmail accounts

**Technical Notes:**
- Use `@googleapis/gmail` npm package
- OAuth scopes needed: `gmail.readonly`, `gmail.labels`
- Similar architecture to Microsoft Graph integration

---

#### Phase 2: Google Calendar Integration (Month 5)
**Goal:** Meeting briefs for Google Calendar

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement Google Calendar API integration
- [ ] Read upcoming meetings (`calendar.events.list`)
- [ ] Get meeting details and attendees
- [ ] Generate meeting briefs for Google Calendar
- [ ] Support both Outlook + Google Calendar

**OAuth Scopes:**
- `calendar.readonly`
- `calendar.events.readonly`

---

#### Phase 3: Google Keep/Docs Integration (Month 5-6)
**Goal:** Note linking for Gmail users

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Research Google Keep API (limited public API)
- [ ] Alternative: Google Docs API for note storage
- [ ] Implement note search and retrieval
- [ ] Link Gmail emails with Google Docs/Keep
- [ ] Support both OneNote + Google Docs

**OAuth Scopes:**
- `drive.readonly` (for Google Docs)
- Google Keep has limited API - may need workarounds

---

#### Phase 4: Unified Experience (Month 6)
**Goal:** Seamless multi-provider support

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Unified inbox (Outlook + Gmail together)
- [ ] Multi-account support (multiple Gmail + Outlook accounts)
- [ ] Account switcher in UI
- [ ] Unified priority classification across providers
- [ ] Cross-provider search
- [ ] Settings per account

**UI Changes:**

---

### Gmail Integration Architecture:

```
src/services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email-service.ts (Outlook - existing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gmail-service.ts (NEW - Gmail)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email-provider-manager.ts (NEW - abstraction layer)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ calendar-service.ts (Outlook - existing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ google-calendar-service.ts (NEW - Google Calendar)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes-service.ts (OneNote - existing)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ google-docs-service.ts (NEW - Google Docs)
```

**Abstraction Layer:**
- Create `IEmailProvider` interface
- Both `EmailService` and `GmailService` implement it
- `EmailProviderManager` handles multiple accounts
- Agent Core works with abstraction, not specific providers

---

### Gmail API Comparison:

| Feature | Microsoft Graph | Gmail API | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | MSAL + Device Code | Google OAuth | Similar flow |
| **Read Emails** | `/me/messages` | `users.messages.list` | Same concept |
| **Search** | `$filter` | `q` parameter | Different syntax |
| **Delta Sync** | Delta queries | History API | Different approach |
| **Labels** | Categories | Labels | Map concepts |
| **Attachments** | `/attachments` | `parts` in message | Different structure |

---

### Revenue Impact of Gmail Integration:

**Current TAM (Outlook only):** 400M users
**With Gmail:** 2.2B users (5.5x larger market!)

**Projected Impact:**
- **Month 6 (Outlook only):** 1,000 users, $800 MRR
- **Month 9 (+ Gmail):** 2,500 users, $2,000 MRR (2.5x growth)
- **Month 12:** 5,000 users, $5,000 MRR

**Why Gmail Users Will Pay:**
- No good AI email assistant for Gmail (Superhuman is $30/mo)
- Gmail AI is basic (just smart compose)
- Your advanced features (meeting briefs, note linking) are unique

---

### Marketing Angle After Gmail Integration:

**Before:** "AI Email Assistant for Outlook"
**After:** "AI Email Assistant for Outlook & Gmail - The Only Tool That Works with Both"

**New Positioning:**
- "Use Outlook for work and Gmail for personal? We've got you covered."
- "The only AI assistant that works with both Microsoft and Google"
- "Unified AI intelligence across all your email accounts"

### Gmail Integration Risks & Mitigation:

**Risk 1: Google API Complexity**
