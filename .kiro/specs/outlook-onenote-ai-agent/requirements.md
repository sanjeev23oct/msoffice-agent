# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building an AI Agent that integrates with Microsoft OneNote and Outlook to assist a Relationship Manager in managing their daily workflow. The agent will monitor emails, highlight important or time-sensitive messages, retrieve relevant notes from OneNote, and provide intelligent assistance for Outlook-based tasks. The goal is to reduce manual effort in tracking communications, meetings, and client information by leveraging AI to surface the right information at the right time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Email Monitoring and Analysis

**User Story:** As a Relationship Manager, I want the AI agent to continuously monitor my Outlook emails, so that I don't miss important communications or deadlines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new email arrives in the user's Outlook inbox THEN the agent SHALL analyze the email content and metadata
2. WHEN the agent analyzes an email THEN it SHALL extract key information including sender, subject, body content, attachments, and timestamp
3. WHEN the agent processes emails THEN it SHALL maintain a connection to the Outlook API without requiring manual intervention
4. IF the Outlook API connection fails THEN the agent SHALL log the error and attempt to reconnect automatically

### Requirement 2: Email Prioritization and Highlighting

**User Story:** As a Relationship Manager, I want the AI agent to identify and highlight important or due emails, so that I can focus on high-priority communications first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent analyzes an email THEN it SHALL classify the email's priority level (high, medium, low) based on content, sender importance, and urgency indicators
2. WHEN an email contains deadline-related keywords (e.g., "urgent", "due by", "deadline", "ASAP") THEN the agent SHALL flag it as high priority
3. WHEN an email is from a VIP contact or key client THEN the agent SHALL automatically mark it as important
4. WHEN the agent identifies a high-priority or due email THEN it SHALL notify the user through a designated notification mechanism
5. WHEN an email contains action items or requests THEN the agent SHALL extract and highlight these items
6. IF an email has a due date mentioned THEN the agent SHALL track the deadline and send reminders

### Requirement 3: OneNote Integration and Note Retrieval

**User Story:** As a Relationship Manager, I want the AI agent to access and retrieve relevant notes from my OneNote, so that I can quickly find client information and meeting notes without manual searching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent is initialized THEN it SHALL establish a connection to the user's OneNote account via Microsoft Graph API
2. WHEN the user requests information about a client or topic THEN the agent SHALL search across all accessible OneNote notebooks for relevant notes
3. WHEN the agent finds relevant notes THEN it SHALL return the note content along with the notebook, section, and page location
4. WHEN processing an email about a specific client THEN the agent SHALL automatically retrieve related OneNote notes for context
5. IF multiple relevant notes are found THEN the agent SHALL rank them by relevance and recency
6. WHEN retrieving notes THEN the agent SHALL preserve formatting and include any embedded images or attachments

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Email-Note Correlation

**User Story:** As a Relationship Manager, I want the AI agent to automatically link emails with relevant OneNote entries, so that I have complete context when responding to communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent processes an email THEN it SHALL identify key entities (client names, company names, project names) mentioned in the email
2. WHEN key entities are identified THEN the agent SHALL search OneNote for notes containing those entities
3. WHEN relevant notes are found THEN the agent SHALL present them alongside the email for context
4. IF no relevant notes are found THEN the agent SHALL suggest creating a new note for this communication
5. WHEN the agent correlates emails and notes THEN it SHALL use semantic similarity in addition to keyword matching

### Requirement 5: Meeting and Calendar Integration

**User Story:** As a Relationship Manager, I want the AI agent to help me manage meetings in Outlook, so that I can efficiently schedule and prepare for client interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent accesses the user's Outlook calendar THEN it SHALL retrieve upcoming meetings and their details
2. WHEN a meeting is scheduled THEN the agent SHALL identify the attendees and search for relevant OneNote notes about them
3. WHEN a meeting is approaching (within 24 hours) THEN the agent SHALL provide a briefing with relevant notes and recent email communications
4. WHEN the user requests to schedule a meeting THEN the agent SHALL check calendar availability and suggest optimal time slots
5. IF a meeting invitation is received THEN the agent SHALL analyze the meeting details and provide context from OneNote and previous emails

### Requirement 6: AI-Powered Insights and Suggestions

**User Story:** As a Relationship Manager, I want the AI agent to provide intelligent insights and suggestions based on my emails and notes, so that I can be more proactive in client management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent analyzes communication patterns THEN it SHALL identify clients who haven't been contacted recently
2. WHEN the agent detects follow-up items in emails THEN it SHALL remind the user if no action has been taken within a reasonable timeframe
3. WHEN the agent reviews meeting notes THEN it SHALL extract action items and track their completion status
4. WHEN the agent identifies trends or patterns THEN it SHALL surface insights to the user (e.g., "You have 3 pending proposals due this week")
5. IF the agent detects potential scheduling conflicts THEN it SHALL alert the user proactively

### Requirement 7: Authentication and Security

**User Story:** As a Relationship Manager, I want the AI agent to securely access my Outlook and OneNote data, so that my sensitive client information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first uses the agent THEN it SHALL require OAuth 2.0 authentication with Microsoft
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the agent SHALL securely store access tokens with encryption
3. WHEN access tokens expire THEN the agent SHALL automatically refresh them using the refresh token
4. WHEN the agent accesses user data THEN it SHALL only request the minimum required permissions (email.read, notes.read, calendars.read)
5. IF authentication fails THEN the agent SHALL provide clear instructions for re-authentication
6. WHEN the agent stores any data locally THEN it SHALL encrypt sensitive information

### Requirement 8: User Interface and Interaction

**User Story:** As a Relationship Manager, I want to interact with the AI agent through a simple interface, so that I can quickly get the information I need without complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the agent interface THEN it SHALL display a dashboard with prioritized emails and upcoming meetings
2. WHEN the user asks a question THEN the agent SHALL respond in natural language with relevant information from emails and notes
3. WHEN the agent provides information THEN it SHALL include source references (email subject, note location) for verification
4. WHEN the user requests a specific action THEN the agent SHALL confirm the action before executing it
5. IF the agent cannot understand a request THEN it SHALL ask clarifying questions
6. WHEN the agent completes a task THEN it SHALL provide confirmation and summary of what was done
