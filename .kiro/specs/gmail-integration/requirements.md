# Gmail Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Outlook-OneNote AI Agent to support Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Workspace (Docs/Keep) integration. The goal is to provide a unified AI-powered email and meeting assistant that works seamlessly with both Microsoft and Google ecosystems, making the product accessible to a much larger market (2.2B users vs 400M Outlook-only users).

The integration will maintain feature parity with the existing Outlook implementation while providing a unified experience for users who use both email providers.
